Note to people testing this and noticing that the google page might have the ERR_BLOCKED_BY_RESPONSE error, or would just prefer a different engine:
    In the following function, just change the linkStart variable to another search engine's url. The default is "https://www.google.com/search?q=", but you could just
    change it to "https://duckduckgo.com/?q=" for DuckDuckGo, or whatever search engine you want.
    
Also, feel free to add some more üòè queries to the list.
