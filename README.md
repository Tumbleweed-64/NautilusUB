Wondering about the description? Well, basically this is a fake proxy. You heard me. Fake. I made this so you can download it and send it to an unsuspecting friend (not virus, see below)

# What is this?

It's basically a troll proxy based on the fact that most students will give anything for unblocked games. It poses as an unblocker, but what it really does is ignore user input and instead, open a Google tab with a... suspicious search query when the "Go!" button is pressed. You can use this to get someone on the school watchlist if you have a grudge or something. I really don't care what you do with this. Just know that if you expected a real proxy, there are better places to look than my repos.

# Note to curious devs

If you go in the <code>scripts.js</code> file, you'll see it's very customizable. You can change the search engine and add even more queries. I recommend testing this program before sending it to a friend, because it acts a little wonky sometimes. Otherwise, have fun, and if you add something interesting, you can fork.

# 2024 UPDATE

V2 is coming in the next week! It will be kept on a separate repo like Tumbleweed-64/NautilusV2. V2 includes insane graphical upgrades like CSS animations, and some new cursed queries. Start an issue if a query is blocked, because that's pretty common with schools.
